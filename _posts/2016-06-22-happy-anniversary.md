Today is our first wedding anniversary. Traditionally the first anniversary is paper, but why not a static website? Totally the same? right?

We're starting out with Jekyll, because there wasn't a good enough reason not to.

Using the hpstr theme because, who wouldn't with a name like that.

(Okay, so I'm also a traditionalist. Poster is from the party where we met.)
